# Melbourne Housing Project
## Objective
  
  It is important to keep internal data free of unwanted escape characters, leading or trailing blanks and even newlines. 
  Similarly it would be useful to be able to attach a cleansing solution to a field in a model and have the data cleansed transparently when required.

  The dataset to be used is a CSV file named [melbourne.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Eo_GmCjyItXNOMhSTTE7Syz0B2AC8WZ/view?usp=sharing),
