# Melbourne Housing Project
## Objective
  
  It is important to keep internal data free of unwanted escape characters, leading or trailing blanks and even newlines. 
  Similarly it would be useful to be able to attach a cleansing solution to a field in a model and have the data cleansed transparently when required.
  
## The Dataset
 
  The dataset to be used is a CSV file named [melbourne.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Eo_GmCjyItXNOMhSTTE7Syz0B2AC8WZ/view?usp=sharing), 
  which contains data on airbnb listings in the state of New York. It contains the following columns:
  
  * Suburbs
  * Address
  * Rooms
  * Type
  * Price
  * SeelerG
  * Date
  * Distance
  * Postcode
  * Bedroom2
  * Bathroom
