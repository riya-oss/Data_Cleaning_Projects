# FIFA 2019 Data Cleaning Project
 
 The majority of data science work often revolves around pre-processing data, and making sure it's ready for analysis.

   * Import data into pandas, and use simple functions to diagnose problems in our data.
   * Visualize missing and out of range data using missingno and seaborn.
   * Apply a range of data cleaning tasks that will ensure the delivery of accurate insights.
 
## The Dataset
  The dataset to be used is a CSV file named [fifa.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQmme2R9TDgX8hsKnzA_3sGiq5GpnB3L/view?usp=sharing) which contains data of details of 
  all the players and their teams playing FIFA world cup 2019.
