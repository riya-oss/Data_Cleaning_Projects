# Big Mart Data Cleaning Project

The majority of data science work often revolves around pre-processing data, and making sure it's ready for analysis.

   * Import data into pandas, and use simple functions to diagnose problems in our data.
   * Visualize missing and out of range data using missingno and seaborn.
   * Apply a range of data cleaning tasks that will ensure the delivery of accurate insights.

# The Dataset

The dataset to be used is a CSV file named [bigmart.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WkDYIU8ybSMOmK6Y_ssRWvNHvUDEMQel/view?usp=sharing) which contains
