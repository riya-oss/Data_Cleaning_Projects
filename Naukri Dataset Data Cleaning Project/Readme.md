# Naukri Dataset Data Cleaning Project
  In the technically advanced world of todayâ€™s, that talks all about machine learning are factually dependent on the accuracy of the data and hence becomes an important parameter to be met. 
  A clean dataset is necessary to produce sensible results. Even if you want to build a model on a dataset, inspecting and cleaning your data can improve your results exponentially. Feeding a model with unnecessary or erroneous data will reduce your model accuracy. A cleaner dataset will give you a better score than any fancy model. A clean dataset will also make it easier for others in your organization to work on it in the future.a clean dataset is necessary to produce sensible results.

 ## How to you Clean Data???
    * Step 1: Remove duplicate or irrelevant observations
    * Step 2: Fix structural errors
    * Step 3: Filter unwanted outliers
    * Step 4: Handle missing data
   
# The Dataset
   The dataset to be used is a CSV file named [naukri.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rya7OjphCjFfH-NQhA-uoHiLaDmoeOVG/view?usp=sharing) which contains data on details of    various candidates who have appllied for the job postings and various companies which have posted their job vancancies. It contains the following columns:
   
   * company	
   * education	
   * experience	
   * industry	
   * jobdescription	
   * jobid	
   * joblocation_address	
   * jobtitle	
   * numberofpositions	
   * payrate	
   * postdate	
   * site_name	
   * skills	
   * uniq_id
