# Naukri Dataset Data Cleaning Project
  In the technically advanced world of today’s, that talks all about machine learning are factually dependent on the accuracy of the data and hence becomes an important parameter to be met. 
  A clean dataset is necessary to produce sensible results. Even if you want to build a model on a dataset, inspecting and cleaning your data can improve your results exponentially. Feeding a model with unnecessary or erroneous data will reduce your model accuracy. A cleaner dataset will give you a better score than any fancy model. A clean dataset will also make it easier for others in your organization to work on it in the future.a clean dataset is necessary to produce sensible results.

 ## How to you Clean Data???
    * Step 1: Remove duplicate or irrelevant observations
    * Step 2: Fix structural errors
    * Step 3: Filter unwanted outliers
    * Step 4: Handle missing data
   
# The Dataset
   The dataset to be used is a CSV file named [naukri.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rya7OjphCjFfH-NQhA-uoHiLaDmoeOVG/view?usp=sharing) which contains data on details of various products in the Mart. It contains the following columns:
   
   * company	
   * education	
   * experience	
   * industry	
   * jobdescription	
   * jobid	
   * joblocation_address	
   * jobtitle	
   * numberofpositions	
   * payrate	
   * postdate	
   * site_name	
   * skills	
   * uniq_id
